    <h1>Fabio Tricarico</h1>
    <p>
      I am an Italian-South African who was born and raised primarily in Cape Town, South Africa but I have also spent a few years throughout my life living in Switzerland. I grew up primarily in the Edgemead suburb of Cape Town, where I attended Edgemead Primary and High School.
      It was during these formative years in high school that I gained a passion for music, literature, and technology. It is due to these passions that I would end up receiving a Bachelor's degree in Psychology and English at Eduvos and why I am currently striving to enter the Software Engineering space.
    </p>
    <p>
       The way in which digital technology is continuously growing and expanding in various fields has intrigued me for a long time. A field which was initially quite niche has become an omnipresent factor in day-to-day life, which is my main motivation to enter this field.
       I am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my skillset and stay updated with the latest web technologies. Additionally, I strive to constantly educate myself and discover the various ways systems interact with one another to obtain a deeper understanding of the systems at hand. I thrive in collaborative environments where I can contribute my expertise while also learning from others.
